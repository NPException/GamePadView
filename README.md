# NP GamePadView

To use this in OBS, I recommend you use the [Spout2 OBS plugin](https://github.com/Off-World-Live/obs-spout2-plugin) if you're on Windows.
If you have it installed, just add a new "Spout2 Capture" to your sources, select the gamepadviewer, and set "Composite Mode" to default:

If you do not have the Spout plugin, you can still add it as a "Game Capture" or "Window Capture".
In this case, you need to add a "Color Key" effect filter to the source, and key out the background, like so:
